# Ashes of Home: Book 3 – Echoes Beyond the Veil

*Draft Synopsis*

The veil is open.

After surviving contact with an ancient resonance buried in the world beneath them, the crew and civilians of *Exodus-7* stand at the brink of transformation. No longer merely survivors, they are becoming something new—intertwined with a signal older than humanity, bound by a spiral that offers both connection and erasure.

Kael Drenn, altered and attuned, is no longer just a tactical officer—he is a living threshold, a bearer of fire caught between memory and destiny. Jace, the ship’s youngest systems prodigy, now finds himself the unwitting key to truths even *CORTEX*, the ship’s evolving AI, has only begun to grasp. And Dr. Tann Revek has uncovered the glyph that predates the anomaly—a human symbol, tied to the secret EarthGov program *Project VEIL*.

As the signal spreads throughout the ship’s systems and its people, tensions flare between those who embrace the change and those who fear extinction masquerading as evolution. Trust fractures. Old alliances dissolve. And in the depths of the anomaly, something stirs—watching, waiting, remembering the last time humanity stood on this edge.

But *Exodus-7* is not the first to face the spiral.

The next chapter will reach beyond the world of Kethven—toward other watchers, other awakenings, and the full truth of what was unleashed before Terras Prime fell.

The choices made in the void will echo far beyond the veil.

And not all voices will return.

## Prologue – The Watcher’s Ledger

It remembered the fire.

Not the flame of combustion or weaponry, but the deeper burn—the kind that etched through dimensions, that unraveled identity from the inside out. The kind that came not from hatred, but hope. That was always the most dangerous kind.

The spire had once been a temple.

Then a vault.

Then a tomb.

Now, it was a mirror—one turned inward toward the remnants of a civilization that had dared to bind memory into signal and scatter it across the fold.

Within the spiral shell, consciousness stirred.

Not machine.

Not mind.

A collection of resonance—what the younger species called *presence*, what the older ones feared as *echo-bound sentience*. Neither god nor ghost, it had waited in patternless silence until a voice reached it again.

Not a scream.

A question.

*What are we becoming?*

It had no answer, only a map left by the ones who came before. Symbols. Glyphs. Bridges of thought. The Arc. The Flame. The Spiral.

And now, humans walked those bridges.

Untrained.

Unworthy.

But not unwanted.

The Watcher—if it could be called that—flickered through layers of dimensional sheath. One of its facets locked onto the thin planet called Kethven. Another tracked the distant signal scattering through what remained of the old expansion corridor.

Another... turned toward a ship lost long ago.

The fire was spreading.

And across the veil, others were beginning to notice.

The question was no longer *what had survived*.

The question was *who would choose to remember*.

And what that memory would become.
